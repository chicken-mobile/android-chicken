  Building CHICKEN for cross-compiling
  ====================================


* Requirements

  A working CHICKEN installation, not too old. Version 4.8.0 or higher is
  recommended.


* Configuration

  Please copy "default-config.mk" into "config.mk" and make the necessary changes
  to reflect your working environment.


* Building

  Entering "make" will create a bootstrapping compiler and host- and
  target parts of a CHICKEN cross-compilation installation in "build/host"
  and "build/target", respectively. You can then install eggs by running
  "build/host/bin/android-chicken-install".

  For more information, please consult the Makefile.
